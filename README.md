🚀 AlphaScout: Advanced Memecoin Analysis AI
AlphaScout is a cutting-edge AI agent designed to analyze memecoin contracts on the blockchain, detect optimal entry and exit points, and provide actionable trading insights based on blockchain data, technical analysis, and real-time signals.

With integrated Telegram Bot support, AlphaScout ensures you stay up-to-date with alerts, insights, and trading suggestions directly in your Telegram app, making it an invaluable tool for memecoin traders.

🧑‍💻 How It Works
Blockchain Analysis:

AlphaScout connects to the blockchain via Infura and collects key data (transactions, balance, holders, etc.).
The data is cached for efficiency, so repeated queries for the same contract address are handled quickly.
Chart Analysis:

AlphaScout visualizes the blockchain data over time using interactive charts.
Support and resistance levels are automatically detected and marked on the charts.

Signal Generation:

Based on transaction counts, balances, and historical data, AlphaScout generates trading signals.
Signals are delivered both through the command line interface (CLI) and Telegram.
Telegram Integration:

Users can interact with the AI via Telegram, requesting real-time analysis for any given contract address.
The bot will respond with buy/sell recommendations and key blockchain insights.
